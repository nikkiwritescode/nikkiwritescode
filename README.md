- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicole!
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud computing, infrastructure as code, writing software, and playing, modding, or otherwise exploring retro games!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build robust public APIs, how to build and deploy enterprise-level cloud infrastructure using Terraform and CI/CD pipelines, and to how to create games that are fun to play using Unity3D.
- 💞️ Thanks for stopping by!
