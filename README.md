- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicole
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud computing, infrastructure as code, writing software, and playing, modding, and otherwise exploring retro games!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build robust public APIs, how to build cloud infrastructure using Terraform and CI/CD pipelines, and to how to create games that are fun to play using Unity3D.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on reverse-engineering and building a server for the first cross-platform console-and-PC network RPG; and for building fun games in Unity!
- 📫 You can easily reach me via Slack and Discord.
